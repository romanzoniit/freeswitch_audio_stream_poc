# FreeSWITCH mod_audio_socket PoC

## Description

This is a simple Python ESL script which initiates a call to a SIP extension and bridges that to a WebSocket endpoint using [mod_audio_socket](https://github.com/amigniter/mod_audio_stream).

## Usage

You'll need to install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (and you will probably want to create virtualenv before that).

After that, create `.env` file (you can use `.env.example` as an example) and update parameters you want to change. You would definitely want to update `SIP_EXTENSION` to your SIP extension number, `WS_ENDPOINT` to your WebSocket endpoint, and, of course, FreeSWITCH ESL credentials (`FS_HOST`, `FS_ESL_PORT`, `FS_ESL_PASSWORD`).

That's it â€” now you can run the script: `python app.py`.
